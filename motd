** CHANGE THE TELEMETRY-REPORTING IP ADDRESS TO YOUR TELEMETRY-COLLECTOR ADDRESS!!

** WE CHANGED THE TEMP SENSORS TO 1-WIRE: YOU *MUST* enable 1-wire in the kernel,
   set pin used (e.g. GPIO 5) in /boot/config.txt, and then set the DEV_INSIDE and
   DEV_OUTSIDE paths to your own device's *UNIQUE* serial numbers!!

Start sending telemetry via Internet

Start sending APRS packets out via Baofeng 888 + VOX
