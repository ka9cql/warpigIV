TO-DO list:

** CHANGE THE TELEMETRY-REPORTING IP ADDRESS TO YOUR TELEMETRY-COLLECTOR ADDRESS!!

** WE CHANGED THE TEMP SENSORS TO 1-WIRE: YOU *MUST* enable 1-wire in the kernel,
   set pin used (e.g. GPIO 5) in /boot/config.txt, and then set the DEV_INSIDE,
   DEV_OUTSIDE and (optionally) DEV_BATTERY paths to your own device's *UNIQUE*
   serial numbers!!

** I DISABLED USB-Ethernet (USB-OTG) because I was having trouble with aplay locking
   up the Syba USB sound card used with 2-way commanding (through direwolf + kissutil)


CHANGE THE GPU-to-CPU MEMORY ALLOCATON TO "all CPU"

INCORPORATE THE GPS-DERIVED TIME (instead of NTP) TO SET THE SYSTEM CLOCK
    IN THE MEAN TIME: SET THE TIME MANUALLY if no NTP server is reachable upon power-up

DELETE THE /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf.**NET FILE

ENSURE that the wpa_supplicant.conf.OPEN file is being used by issuing this command -

       cp /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf.OPEN /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

ERASE all "replay-protection" APRS message-ID numbers from the /usr/local/bin/seen directory

Start sending telemetry via Internet

Start sending APRS packets out via USB soundcard + KJ6FO I/F + GPIO 21 PTT + Baofeng 888

MODIFY (or delete) the /etc/motd file that contains these instructions (IF MODIFY - add contact info?)
