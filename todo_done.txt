TO-DOs and DONEs for Warpig-IV
==========================

TO-DOs -
========
Set default Raspberry Pi audio output to use PWM0/PWM1 (Warpig-IV only uses PWM0)
    Add the following to /boot/config.txt -
        dtoverlay=pwm-2chan,pin=18,func=2,pin2=13,func2=4

Set default playback Raspberry Pi audio output level to -10.55 dBm
    Use alsamixer command to do this

Set *both* temperature readings to the same (single) I2C sensor (TC74A5)

((Experiment: Try using RFKill every (x) seconds to "free up" the WiFi interface to try new OPEN Access Points, instead of getting "stuck" on one - that is possibly something that has no Internet access, or might have drifted "out-of-sight" by the time we go to try using it...))

Replace all ".git" IP addresses, "Project name", callsign and credentials (etc.) with "final" versions in APRS-reporting/telemetry/etc. locations within scripts/files/etc.
    Set correct IP address in "balloonSend.py"
    Set correct Amateur Radio callsign in "makePacket.sh"
    Set correct APRS path (e.g. "WIDEx-y") in "makePacket.sh"

Change all telemetry-reporting, picture-taking, "redo"/"retry" intervals to "flight values" (e.g. "repeat every-x-seconds...")

Attach crepe streamers, visual aides, (etc.) to payload

Attach CONTACT INFORMATION to payload (aka "Reward If Found", "email/call us at...")

REMOVE TESTING FILES - including:
    * wpa_config.WHATEVER files that contain non-flight WPA2 passwords!!
    * Old pictures, logfiles, GPS data, (etc.) that may have been picked up via .git from previous flights

ENSURE THE SD CARD HAS ADEQUATE STORAGE SPACE REMAINING FOR YOUR FLIGHT's NEEDS
    (e.g. If you are flying a camera, have you set the picture interval correctly to match the expected flight duration?)

MAKE A COMPLETE BACKUP of the SD card as close to the launch as you can!!  (All those "little tweaks" will eventually be forgotten...)



DONEs -
========
Set VOX sensitivity on Baofeng 888 to 1
    We think this is the "most sensitive" setting, but can't definitively prove it

Set all 16 channels of Baofeng 888 to 144.390 FM Simplex with High power
    Use CHIPR radio-programming software to do this... more to follow...

Turn off Power Management on the wlan0 WiFi interface
    Add this line to /etc/rc.local -
        /sbin/iw dev wlan0 set power_save off

Chop the MIC element off the Baofeng 888 (otherwise wind noises, etc) would trigger RF transmission on the APRS output frequency!!!
