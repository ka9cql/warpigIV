# gpsDaemon - Script intended to be launched in the background, and which
#             repeatedly refreshes the last-known-good position (LAT/LON/ALT)
#             data stored on the filesystem for other programs to pick up later.
#
# HISTORICAL INFORMATION -
#
#  2018-01-21  msipin  Created
#  2018-02-10  msipin  Moved delay out of error condition, and just always do it.
#  2019-04-29  msipin  Adjusted to the fact that GPSD has now taken over reading from
#                      the GPS serial port.
#################

# NEW FOR GPSD -
# Give GPSD time to start up
